# LongTREC Bioinformatics Summer School

Welcome to the **LongTREC Bioinformatics Summer School on Analysis of Long-Reads Technology Data**.

We have organised a 4-day course with the aim of introducing master’s students, doctoral candidates, and early career postdoctoral fellows into the super exciting world of long-read RNA sequencing. In this course, we will introduce you to diverse topics—from an introduction to the technologies and basic data processing, to analyzing long-reads transcriptomics, single-cell long-reads, and many other exciting topics.

## What Will I Learn?

- An overview of different long-read sequencing technologies
- Best practice in experimental design
- How to evaluate quality control reads using SQANTI-reads
- How to use long-reads to identify and quantify transcripts
- Hands-on experience in genome and functional annotation
- Hands-on experience in differential expression analysis and haplotype identification
- Identification of RNA modifications using long reads
- An overview of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics
- Principles and practice of metatranscriptomics with long reads

## Who Is This Training For?

Early career researchers who are in the grant application or experimental design stages of projects centered around long-read sequencing.

## Course Pre-requisites

Familiarity with the command line is recommended. You should be familiar with the basics as taught in the [Software Carpentry lesson on The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), or work through these materials before the training starts.

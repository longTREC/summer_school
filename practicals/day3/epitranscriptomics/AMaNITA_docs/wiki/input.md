# ðŸ“© Expected Input

AMaNITA is built to run either on (1) basecalled and aligned data (BAM files), or on (2) processed abundance and modification TSV files. This is a walkthrough on what the expected input data in each case looks like.

## 1. ðŸ’£ BAM files

An example of expected input BAM files can be found inside [the demo1 directory](https://github.com/novoalab/AMaNITA/tree/master/data/demo1). To note:

- BAM file naming convention: `reads.{BAMID}.bam`

Please check out [this walkthrough]() on how to generate the BAM files.

## 2. ðŸ“‚ TSV files

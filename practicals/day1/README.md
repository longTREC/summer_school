# Day 1 Practical Session - LongTREC Summer School

## Overview
This practical session covers long-read transcriptome analysis with a focus on alignment methods and quality control using SQANTI-reads.

## Content
- **Experiment Design**: LRGASP Challenge 2 subset focusing on chromosome 8 and endoderm differentiation
- **Hands-on Part 1**: Comparison of minimap2 and uLTRA aligners
- **Hands-on Part 2**: SQANTI-reads concepts and applications

## Files
- `day1_practical.tex`: Main presentation file
- `beamerthemeLongTREC.sty`: LongTREC beamer theme
- `images/`: Logo files required for the presentation
- `README.md`: This file

## Compilation
To compile the presentation:

```bash
pdflatex day1_practical.tex
```

## Requirements
- LaTeX distribution (TeXLive, MiKTeX, etc.)
- Required packages: beamer, tikz, pgfplots
- The presentation uses the custom LongTREC beamer theme

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this practical session, participants will:
1. Understand the experimental design rationale for chromosome 8 selection
2. Be able to compare and use minimap2 vs uLTRA aligners
3. Understand SQANTI3 structural categories (FSM, ISM, NIC, NNC)
4. Grasp the concept of Unique Junction Chains (UJC)
5. Know how to interpret SQANTI-reads output and reports

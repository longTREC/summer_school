## Course Description

Welcome to the LongTREC Bioinformatics Summer School on Analysis of Long-Reads Technology Data.

We have organized a comprehensive 4-day course designed for master's students, doctoral candidates, and early career postdoctoral fellows interested in exploring the exciting world of long-read RNA sequencing. Throughout this course, you will be introduced to a diverse range of topicsâ€”from fundamental technologies and basic data processing to advanced applications including long-read transcriptomics, single-cell analysis, and many other exciting topics.

## Target Audience

This training is specifically designed for early career researchers who are:
* In the grant application phase for long-read sequencing projects
* Planning experimental design for studies centered around long-read technologies
* Looking to expand their bioinformatics toolkit with cutting-edge long-read analysis methods

## What Will You Learn?

* **Technologies & Fundamentals**
  * Comprehensive overview of different long-read sequencing technologies
  * Best practices in experimental design
  * Quality control evaluation using SQANTI-reads

* **Analysis & Applications**
  * Transcript identification and quantification using long reads
  * Structural annotation evaluation  
  * Differential expression analysis and haplotype identification
  * RNA modifications detection with long reads

* **Advanced Topics**
  * Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics approaches
  * Principles and practical applications of metatranscriptomics
